# work-scheduler

A scheduler that notes tasks!

This work scheduler meets the following criteria:

- This is a daily planner that can be used to create a schedule during work hours (9 AM - 5 PM)
- The current date is displayed on the top of the page
- The timeblocks are presented for each business hour (9 AM - 5 PM)
- The timeblocks are color coded to indicate past, present, or future
- The events can be saved onto each timeblock after clicking the "SAVE" button
- The text that is saved onto each timeblock is saved in the local storage
- When the page is refreshed, the text (event) saved persists

The following is a screenshot of what the page should look like when working properly:
